\textit{How can an LED be used as a receiver?}
The LED is used in reverse bias and therefore behaves similar to a capacitor. This means we charge it and let it discharge. We calculate the discharging time and since this time is proportional to the amount of received light on the diode we can use it to receive data.

\textit{Why is synchronization necessary and how is it achieved?}

\textit{What is	the	benefit	from using an LED as a receiver instead of a photodiode? }
Many devices already have an LED, so no additional costs.
One simple LED is also very cheap and in consumer electronics we want to keep the price as low as possible.
